The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 25, 2022.

## Log

### R1D1 
Beginning the JS Algorithms and Data Structures certification course on freeCodeCamp.org to get reacquainted with JS. Starting with the Basic JS course, 22/113 complete.

### R1D2
Continuing with cert course, 36/113. 

### R1D3
I created a separate repository to track my progress outside of the main challenge's branch. My version of this challenge deviates from the official Twitter-based challenge because I am aiming to practice coding at least 30 minutes per day instead of a full hour and I am starting with JavaScript exercises first before doing projects for the completion of my certificate on freeCodeCamp. 

Needed help on the "Word Blanks" portion of the course, 40/113 complete.

### R1D4 
Was not able to code on 1/28/2022. 50/113 coding challenges complete in Basic JS course.

### R1D5 
Missed a day (1/30/31). 57/113 challenges completed in Basic JS course. Got assistance with "Stand in Line" and "Assignment with a Returned Value". 

### R1D6
75/113 challenges completed in Basic JS course. 

### R1D7 
81/113 challenges completed in Basic JS course. Needed assistance with "Selecting from Many Options with Switch Cases" exercise.

### R1D8
Missed a couple days of coding. 86/113 exercises completed in Basic JS course. Needed assistance with "Counting Cards" exercise. Will start downloading solutions on questions I need help with.

### R1D9
94/113 challenges complete. Needed help with "Testing Objects for Properties" exercise, downloaded solution. 

### R1D10
100/113 challenges complete. Checked solution on "Record Collection" and downloaded. Looked at hint for "Iterate with JS while loops" because I was getting an infinite loop error. I am going to be more specific in my notes about whether I am getting help through hints, solutions, or Googling. Also looked at the solution on "Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop" exercise, I needed to declare the variable with let. 

### R1D11 
104/113 challenges complete. I looked at freeCodeCamp comments, Stack Overflow, and Quora for "Nesting for Loops" exercise. I ended up having a curly bracket in the wrong place, fixed that and solved it. I also looked at the hints and the solution on the "Profile Lookup" exercise. I needed to make a for loop and nest the if...else statements. Solution downloaded.

### R1D12
109/113 challenges complete. They have become increasingly more difficult to solve as I have progressed through the course, which has caused me to be more resourceful. I looked for help in freeCodeCamp comments on "Generate Random Whole Numbers with JS" exercise and I realized I wasn't being specific in my return and made the change then solved. 

I looked at the hint on "Use the parseInt() function" exercise, another return issue. Fixed and solved. 

Looked at freeCodeCamp comments to understand "Use the parseInt Function with a Radix" exercise example. Learned about binary number systems. 

### R1D13
113/113 Basic JS Challanges complete! Found help on StackOverFlow on "Use recursion to create a countdown" challenge where I learned about the .unshift method and used it for my first time.  

I watched a video for help on "Use recursion to create a range of numbers" challenge. 

### R1D14
Began the ES6 portion of JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithm certification course, 4/29 exercises complete. Looked at hints and comments for "Mutate an Array Declare with Const" exercise as well as Github.
