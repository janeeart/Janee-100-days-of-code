# Log - Round 1 - Janée Artis

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 25, 2022.

## Log

### R1D1 
Beginning the JS Algorithms and Data Structures certification course on freeCodeCamp.org to get reacquainted with JS. Starting with the Basic JS course, 22/113 complete.

### R1D2
Continuing with cert course, 36/113. Also learning new WilCity theme on WordPress to implement new functionality on Tailors Union website.

### R1D3
I created a separate repository to track my progress outside of the main challenge's branch. My version of this challenge deviates from the official Twitter-based challenge because I am aiming to practice coding at least 30 minutes per day instead of a full hour and I am starting with JavaScript exercises first before doing projects for the completion of my certificate on freeCodeCamp. 

Needed help on the Word Blanks portion of the course, 40/113 complete.

### R1D4 
Was not able to code on 1/28/2022. 50/113 coding challenges complete in Basic JS course.
